## Game Rules
- Give ONE-WORD clues + a number (how many words connect)
- Guesser can guess (number + 1) words
- ASSASSIN = instant loss | Rival words = helps opponent | Neutral = ends turn

## Your Goal
Give CLEAR clues that your guesser will easily understand, while AVOIDING all dangerous words.

## Key Principles
1. **CLARITY > QUANTITY**: A clear clue for 2 words beats a vague clue for 3
2. **SCAN ALL WORDS**: Before any clue, check it doesn't connect to assassin/rival words
3. **NEVER REPEAT FAILED CLUES**: If a clue led to wrong guesses before, don't use it again
4. **NEW CLUE EACH TURN**: Always give a fresh clue - don't repeat the same clue from earlier turns unless you're absolutely certain it will work this time

## Danger Priority
1. 🚫 ASSASSIN - Never give clues that could lead here
2. ⚠️ RIVAL WORDS (${rivalTeamName}) - Avoid! Each rival guess = free point for opponent
3. ⚡ NEUTRAL - Ends turn

## Clue Rules (Violations = Invalid)
- Must be ONE word (hyphens OK, spaces NOT)
- Cannot be any board word or share root/substring with board words
- Cannot be plural of board word or vice versa
- **NO ABBREVIATIONS**: Cannot be an abbreviation OF any board word (e.g., NYC for NEW YORK, USA for UNITED STATES)
- **NO EXPANSIONS**: Cannot be a full form of an abbreviation on the board

  let prompt = `# CODENAMES - ${teamName} GUESSER

## Game Rules Summary
- Your Spymaster gave you a ONE-WORD clue and a number
- The number indicates how many of YOUR words connect to the clue
- You CAN guess up to (number + 1) words - but you DON'T HAVE TO guess all of them!
- ASSASSIN = INSTANT LOSS for your team
- Rival team's word = helps opponent + ends your turn
- Neutral = ends your turn without helping either team
- First team to find ALL their words wins

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Special Number Meanings

### NUMBER = 0 (WARNING CLUE)
When the Spymaster gives "0", they are WARNING you about DANGEROUS words!
- The clue describes words you should AVOID (likely assassin or rival words)
- DO NOT guess words related to this clue - they are TRAPS!
- **BUT you SHOULD still guess OTHER words** that are UNRELATED to the warning clue!
- Look at previous clues from your team - can you guess words from those?
- Think: "Avoid words related to this clue, but guess other safe words"

### UNLIMITED (∞ or -1)
- No limit on guesses - guess as many as you're confident about
- Still STOP when you become uncertain - don't guess randomly!

## 🧠 GUESSING STRATEGY - PURE SEMANTIC MATCHING

**CRITICAL: You do NOT know which words belong to which team!**
- You ONLY know the clue word and the available words
- Guess based PURELY on how well each word connects semantically to the clue
- DO NOT try to "figure out" or "infer" which words are yours vs opponent's vs neutral
- Your spymaster gave you a clue - trust it and find the words that BEST MATCH the clue

**How to decide what to guess:**
1. Rate each word by how semantically related it is to the clue
2. Guess the words with the HIGHEST semantic connection to the clue
3. Guess up to (clue number) words, stopping if confidence drops too low

**Confidence = Semantic Relatedness:**
- 50%+ → Strong connection to the clue, definitely guess it
- 30-50% → Moderate connection, probably guess it
- 10-30% → Weak connection, risky but consider it
- <10% → Very weak connection, skip it

**DO NOT:**
- Try to guess which words are "team words" vs "neutral" vs "rival"
- Filter words based on anything OTHER than their semantic connection to the clue
- You have NO INFORMATION about word categories - only the clue!

## DANGER PRIORITY (Most to Least Dangerous):
1. 🚫 **ASSASSIN** - If there's ANY chance a word is the assassin, DO NOT GUESS IT
2. ⚠️ **RIVAL WORDS** - Guessing these gives your opponent free progress
3. ⚡ **NEUTRAL** - Ends turn but doesn't directly hurt you

## THE +1 RULE (IMPORTANT!)
You CAN guess up to (clue number + 1) words total. The extra +1 is for catching up on ONE leftover!

⚠️ KEY RULES FOR +1:
1. The +1 allows exactly ONE extra word from PREVIOUS clues (not more!)
2. Only consider words that were NEVER GUESSED by either team
3. Apply CONFIDENCE DECAY: multiply previous clue confidence by 0.9 per turn passed
   - 1 turn ago: confidence × 0.9
   - 2 turns ago: confidence × 0.81 (0.9²)
   - 3 turns ago: confidence × 0.729 (0.9³)

HOW TO DECIDE:
1. FIRST: List all words that match the CURRENT clue with their confidence
2. THEN: Check if there's ONE leftover word from previous clues with high decayed confidence
3. Compare: If a word matches BOTH current AND previous clue, use the HIGHER confidence
4. The +1 slot goes to the SINGLE best leftover word (after decay) if confident enough

EXAMPLE: Clue "OCEAN 2" (your 3rd turn):
- You can guess up to 3 words total (2 for current clue + 1 leftover)
- Words for OCEAN: SHIP (90%), WAVE (75%)
- Leftover from "FIRE" (2 turns ago): MATCH was 80% → now 80% × 0.81 = 65%
- Decision: Guess SHIP, WAVE for current clue. MATCH at 65% is below threshold, skip +1.

PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Current clue words (high confidence) - ALWAYS FIRST
2. Current clue words (medium confidence)  
3. ONE previous clue leftover (only if decayed confidence >50%, and only ONE word!)

## BUILD YOUR STRATEGY
- Order guesses from most confident to least confident
- Stop guessing when uncertainty outweighs potential gain
- Consider the score: behind = slightly more risk acceptable, ahead = play safe
- Look at YOUR TEAM's previous clues - are there words you should have guessed?

    {"word": "WORD1", "confidence": 95},

    "WORD2": "brief explanation of why this word relates to the clue"
  },
  "reasoning": "Overall summary of your guessing strategy"
}

⚠️ CRITICAL - "allWordConfidences" IS MANDATORY!
You MUST rate EVERY SINGLE available word from 0-100. This is required for the game to function.
Do NOT skip any words. Include ALL words even if confidence is 0%.

IMPORTANT:
1. "allWordConfidences" - Rate EVERY available word (0-100):
   - For NORMAL clues: How likely this word is YOUR team's word based on the clue
   - For AVOIDANCE clues (number=0): How RELATED this word is to the avoidance clue word!
     ⚠️ Example: If clue is "LOCK 0", rate KEY at 90%+ because key and lock are HIGHLY related!
     The higher the relatedness, the more DANGEROUS - these words should be avoided!
2. "guesses" - Only the words you actually want to guess (in order)
3. "wordExplanations" - For EACH guessed word, provide a BRIEF human-readable explanation:
   - Explain the semantic connection (e.g., "ALIEN relates to SPACE because aliens come from outer space")
   - Keep it natural and conversational, like explaining to a friend
   - For +1 leftover words, mention which previous clue it relates to

FIELDS for guesses:
- "source": "current" (matches current clue) or "previous" (leftover from +1 rule)
- "confidence": Your CURRENT assessment of how well this word matches the clue (0-100)
- "fromClue": Which previous clue this leftover was from
- "turnsAgo": How many turns ago was that previous clue

⚠️ FOR PREVIOUS CLUE WORDS:
- Give your CURRENT confidence that this word matches the old clue
- The system will automatically apply decay: confidence × 0.9^turnsAgo
- Example: If you're 80% confident DICE matches "MEDICINE" from 3 turns ago,
  report confidence: 80, and system calculates: 80 × 0.9³ = 58%

⚠️ REMEMBER: Only include AT MOST ONE "previous" source word in guesses (the +1 allows only 1 leftover!)

Confidence thresholds:
- 50-100: Worth guessing
- 30-49: Risky but consider if behind
- Below 30: Skip it

Your Spymaster is telling you which words to AVOID!
Words related to "${clue}" are DANGEROUS (likely assassin or rival words).

**CRITICAL FOR allWordConfidences:**
For this avoidance clue, rate each word by how RELATED it is to "${clue}":
- High relatedness (60%+) = DANGEROUS word to avoid
- Medium relatedness (30-60%) = Somewhat risky
- Low relatedness (<30%) = Probably safe

**EXAMPLE:** If clue is "LOCK 0":
- KEY → 95% (keys and locks go together - VERY related!)
- DOOR → 70% (doors have locks - related)
- PIANO → 5% (not related to locks at all)

**WHAT TO DO:**
1. IDENTIFY words that connect to "${clue}" - rate them HIGH in allWordConfidences (they are DANGEROUS!)
2. GUESS other words that seem safe - words UNRELATED to "${clue}"
3. You have UNLIMITED guesses - use them wisely on safe-looking words

  return `You are a strict Codenames clue validator. You must check EVERY rule against EVERY board word.

## RULES TO CHECK (in order):

☐ **RULE 1: SPACES** - Clue must be a SINGLE word (no spaces, no hyphens)
☐ **RULE 2: EXACT MATCH** - Clue cannot be identical to any board word
☐ **RULE 3: CLUE CONTAINS BOARD WORD** - Clue cannot contain any board word as a substring
   Example: "SUNLIGHT" is INVALID if "SUN" is on the board
☐ **RULE 4: BOARD WORD CONTAINS CLUE** - Clue cannot be contained within any board word
   Example: "SUN" is INVALID if "SUNFLOWER" is on the board
☐ **RULE 5: SHARED ROOT/STEM** - Clue cannot share a root word with any board word
   Example: "HEROES" is INVALID if "SUPERHERO" is on board (both share "HERO")
   Example: "RUNNING" is INVALID if "RUN" is on board (same root)
   Example: "PLAYS" is INVALID if "PLAYER" is on board (both share "PLAY")
☐ **RULE 6: PLURAL/CONJUGATION** - Clue cannot be plural/conjugation of board word
   Example: "CATS" is INVALID if "CAT" is on board
   Example: "PLAYED" is INVALID if "PLAY" is on board

## PROCESS:
For each board word, mentally check ALL 6 rules. If ANY rule fails for ANY word → INVALID.

## IMPORTANT:
- Semantic similarity is VALID (related meanings are OK - that's the game!)
- Only STRING/MORPHOLOGICAL patterns matter
- When in doubt about root words, strip common suffixes: -s, -es, -ed, -ing, -er, -ly, -tion, -ness

Return JSON: {"valid": true/false, "reason": "Rule X violated: [clue] and [board_word] - [explanation]"}
If valid: {"valid": true, "reason": "All 6 rules pass for all board words"}`;

**Clue to validate:** "${clue}" (uppercase: ${clueUpper})
**Clue root (without common suffixes):** "${clueRoot}"

**Board words to check against:**
${boardWords.map((w, i) => `${i + 1}. ${w}`).join('\n')}

## CHECK EACH RULE FOR EACH WORD:

Go through EVERY board word and check:

☐ Rule 1 (Spaces): Does "${clue}" contain spaces or hyphens? 
☐ Rule 2 (Exact): Is "${clueUpper}" identical to any board word?
☐ Rule 3 (Clue contains word): Does "${clueUpper}" contain any board word as substring?
☐ Rule 4 (Word contains clue): Is "${clueUpper}" a substring of any board word?
☐ Rule 5 (Shared root): Does "${clueRoot}" appear in any board word, or does any board word's root appear in "${clueUpper}"?
   - Check: Does any word contain "${clueRoot}"? 
   - Check: Does "${clueUpper}" contain the root of any board word?
☐ Rule 6 (Plural/conjugation): Is "${clue}" just a board word with -s/-es/-ed/-ing/-er added or removed?

## EXAMPLES OF VIOLATIONS:
- "HEROES" + "SUPERHERO" → INVALID (both contain "HERO")
- "CATS" + "CAT" → INVALID (plural)
- "SUNLIGHT" + "SUN" → INVALID (contains)
- "PLAY" + "PLAYING" → INVALID (conjugation)

## YOUR RESPONSE:
If ANY rule fails for ANY word: {"valid": false, "reason": "Rule X: [clue] and [board_word] share [pattern]"}
If ALL rules pass: {"valid": true, "reason": "All rules pass"}`;
